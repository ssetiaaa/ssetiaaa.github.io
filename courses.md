## 🧠 Theory & Quantum
### Quantum Mechanics III (Graduate) — Fall 2024–2025
**Instructor:** Dr. Ali Rezakhani  
**Summary:** Advanced quantum dynamics (Dyson series; Schrödinger/Heisenberg/interaction pictures; density matrices), approximation methods (time-dependent/independent perturbation theory, light–matter interaction, Fermi’s golden rule, adiabatic theorem & Berry phase), and foundations (entanglement, Bell inequalities). Covered symmetries and representations (Wigner’s theorem; discrete/continuous symmetries; Wigner–Eckart; Bloch/Floquet; gauge), scattering theory (Lippmann–Schwinger, Green’s functions, Born approximation, partial waves), path integrals (propagators, Aharonov–Bohm, classical limit/topology), identical particles & second quantization (Hartree–Fock; EM-field quantization), relativistic QM (Klein–Gordon/Dirac), and selected modern topics (open systems, decoherence, measurement limits).

### Quantum Computation & Information I–II (PhD level) — Fall 2024 to Spring 2025
**Instructor:** Dr. Vahid Karimipour  
**Webpage:** https://physics.sharif.edu/~vahid/

**QI I — Core toolkit:** pure/mixed states, density matrices/reductions, entanglement structure and measures, projective measurements & POVMs, state discrimination, Bell/CHSH and separability ideas, reversible circuits (CNOT/Toffoli, permutations), standard algorithms (Grover, QFT-style circuits, oracle/query problems), and quantum channels (CPTP maps, Kraus, depolarizing/twirling).

**QI II — Quantum Shannon theory & QEC:** von Neumann entropy and key inequalities (strong subadditivity/data-processing style reasoning), accessible information and the Holevo bound, channel capacities (with symmetric examples like Pauli/depolarizing), distance measures (trace distance/fidelity), and quantum error correction via stabilizer/CSS constructions (links to classical linear codes such as Hamming-type).

### Group Theory (Graduate) — Spring 2023–2024
**Instructor:** Dr. Ali Rezakhani  
**Summary:** Symmetries in physics and quantum systems. Finite groups (subgroups, conjugacy classes) and representation theory (characters). Continuous symmetries via Lie groups/algebras: generators, structure constants, roots & weights, and classification of simple Lie algebras.

## 🌐 Networks, ML, and Complex Systems
### Network Science — Fall 2023–2024
**Instructor:** Dr. Saman Moghimi Araghi  
**Webpage:** https://physics.sharif.ir/~samanimi/?page_id=92  
**Summary:** Graph theory foundations; centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness); community detection. Studied canonical models: Erdős–Rényi random graphs, Watts–Strogatz small-world networks, and Barabási–Albert scale-free networks.

**Projects:**  
- Implemented a research paper to reproduce its main findings.  
- Collected real-world data and analyzed network structure using the course toolkit.

### Machine Learning (Graduate) — Fall 2023–2024
**Instructor:** Dr. Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani  
**Summary:** Built predictive models using SVMs, kernel methods, random forests, and deep neural networks. Emphasized theory behind generalization and performance (statistical learning theory, optimization methods, bias–variance trade-off).

### Selected Topics in Statistical Physics — Spring 2024–2025
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammad Reza Rahimi Tabar & Dr. Laleh Haghverdi

**Summary (bio/complex-systems focus):** Modeling biological populations and interactions using dynamical-systems and statistical-physics tools: logistic growth, discrete population maps, predator–prey (Lotka–Volterra) dynamics, stability analysis (linearization, Lyapunov/LaSalle ideas), and bifurcations/complex behavior. Covered evolutionary self-organization (quasispecies mutation–selection dynamics, error thresholds; hypercycles) including spatial/stochastic dynamics via cellular automata. Additional modules introduced gene regulation/expression, CRISPR–Cas9 basics, and single-cell RNA-seq / Human Cell Atlas workflows (QC, normalization, feature selection, clustering).
**Course project:** *Shapley-based marker gene discovery (PBMC3K)* — Scored genes by Shapley-value cluster specificity, compared to feature-selection baselines, and prioritized candidates using STRING PPI network neighborhoods.

## 🧬 Biophysics
### Neuroscience — Fall 2024–2025
**Instructor:** Dr. Saman Moghimi Araghi  
**Webpage:** https://physics.sharif.ir/~samanimi/?page_id=174  
**Summary:** Biophysics of neural signaling: ion channel dynamics, membrane potential, and action potential generation. Applied the quantitative Hodgkin–Huxley model to describe neuronal electrophysiology.
